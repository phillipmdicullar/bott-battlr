# PHASE 2 CODE CHALLENGE 2: BOTS BOTTLR

## Prerequisites

- For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of available bots, among other features. Try your best to find the right places to insert code into the established code base.

- Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in
  how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for setting up the application.

### Requirements

- For this project, you must:

  - Have a well-written README file.

- Welcome to *Bot Battlr*, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army! This is our app:

- Here's the scenario: a galactic overlord has hired you, a galactic web developer, to develop a galactic web app that will allow them to browse through a list of robots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot into their army.
